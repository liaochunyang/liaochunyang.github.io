## Optimal Recovery ##

Currently, I am working on optimal recovery which is a subfield of Approximation Theory. The goal of optimal recovery is to recover a function known to belong to a certain class from prescribed data. This task is solved deterministically by adopting a worst-case perspective. My goal is to design tractable algorithms that return the optimal recovery map. Some recent papers with reproducible files can be found [here](https://github.com/liaochunyang/Optimal_Recovery).
