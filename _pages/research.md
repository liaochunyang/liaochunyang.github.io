My research interests belong to Mathematics of Data Science, Approximation Theory, (Deep) Learning Theory, and in particular their intersections.

## Optimal Recovery ##

Currently, I am working on Optimal Recovery which is a subfield of Approximation Theory. I am working on Optimal Recovery, whose main task is to approximate a function from observations by adopting a worst-case error perspective tied to an explicit model assumption made on the function to be recovered. The Optimal Recovery framework has a closed relation to Learning Theory, Inverse Problem, and Numerical Analysis. My goal is to design tractable algorithms that returns the optimal approximant minimizing the worst-case error. Some recent papers with reproducible files can be found [here](https://github.com/liaochunyang/Optimal_Recovery).
