## Optimal Recovery ##

Currently, I am working on Optimal Recovery which is a subfield of Approximation Theory. The goal of Optimal Recovery is to recover a function (a quantity depending on a function) known to belong to a certain class from prescribed data. This task is solved deterministically by adopting a worst-case perspective. My goal is to design tractable algorithms that returns the optimal approximant minimizing the worst-case error. Some recent papers with reproducible files can be found [here](https://github.com/liaochunyang/Optimal_Recovery).
