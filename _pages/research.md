## Current Research ##

### Optimal Recovery ###

Recently, I am working on optimal recovery. The goal of optimal recovery is to recover a function from non-random, even unfavorable observations. This task is solved deterministically by adopting a worst-case error perspective. I study optimal recovery from computational point of view. In other words, I am trying to design tractable algorithms to return a best approximant of the unknown function, which minimizes the worst-case error. Some relevant work with reproducible files can be found [here](https://github.com/liaochunyang/COR).

## Projects ##

### TAMIDS Course Development for MATH 664: Topics in Mathematical Data Science (June 2021-Aug 2021) ###

This project is supported by Texas A&M Institute of Data Science. I help Dr.Simon Foucart to write computational illustrations accompanying his book Mathematical Pictures at a Data Science Exhibition, which is also the textbook for MATH 664. The main topics of this illustrations contains Machine Learning (Basic Theory, Support Vector Machine, Regularization, Clustering and Dimension Reduction), Optimal Recovery, Compressive Sensing (Sparse Recovery, Low-rank recovery, Group Testing), Optimization (Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, Duality, Nonconvex Optimization) and Neural Networks. Details can be found in <a href="https://github.com/foucart/Mathematical_Pictures_at_a_Data_Science_Exhibition" target="_blank">Dr.Foucart's Github Page</a>.
