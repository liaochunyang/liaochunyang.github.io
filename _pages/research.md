### Optimal Recovery ###

The goal of optimal recovery is to recover a function known to belong to a certain class from exact or noisy prescribed data. This task is solved deterministically by adopting a worst-case perspective. I study optimal recovery from computational point of view. In other words, I am trying to design tractable algorithms to return a best approximant of the unknown function, which minimizes the worst-case error. Some relevant work with reproducible files can be found [here](https://github.com/liaochunyang/COR).
