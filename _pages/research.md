Optimal Recovery 
Recently, I am working on optimal recovery, which is a subfield of approximation theory. Our goal is designing efficient algorithm to recover a function from prescribed data. It's not assumed that the inputs are realizations of a random variable with (unknown) distribution, which is the biggest difference between our scenario and statistical learning setting.

TAMIDS Course Development for MATH 664: Topics in Mathematical Data Science (June 2021-Aug 2021)
This project is supported by Texas A&M Institute of Data Science. I help Prof.Simon Foucart to write computational illustrations accompanying the book Mathematical Pictures at a Data Science Exhibition, which is also the textbook for MATH 664. The main topics of this illustrations contains Machine Learning (Basic Theory, Support Vector Machine, Regularization, Clustering and Dimension Reduction), Optimal Recovery, Compressive Sensing (Sparse Recovery, Low-rank recovery, Group Testing), Optimization (Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, Duality, Nonconvex Optimization) and Neural Networks. Details can be found in Dr.Foucart's Github Page.
