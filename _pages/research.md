My research interests belong to Mathematics of Data Science, Approximation Theory, (Deep) Learning Theory, and in particular their intersections.

## Optimal Recovery ##

Optimal Recovery, whose main task is to approximate an unknown function from observations and an explicit model assumption on the function to be recovered, is a subfield of Approximation Theory. The problem is considered under deterministic problem setting where we assume the observational error is bounded not random. To assess the performance, we adopt worst-case error perspective which is key to optimal recovery. 

#### The goal of my research is to design tractable algorithms that return an optimal approximater in the sense that the worst-case error is minimized. ####
 
 The Optimal Recovery framework has a closed relation to Learning Theory, Inverse Problem, and Numerical Analysis. My goal is to design tractable algorithms that returns the optimal approximant minimizing the worst-case error. Some recent papers with reproducible files can be found [here](https://github.com/liaochunyang/Optimal_Recovery).
